# AWS-Based Fake News Detection

Developed a cloud-based fake news analysis system using AWS serverless architecture that evaluates content trustworthiness through relevance scoring. The system processes text or images through a three-stage pipeline: input extraction via AWS Textract, entity recognition using Google Cloud's Natural Language API, and credibility assessment through GDELT database cross-referencing. The system calculates a simple numerical relevance score (0-4) by matching extracted entities (people, organizations, locations) and categories between user input and trusted news sources. This transparent approach avoids black-box classification while providing quantifiable credibility metrics. Implemented using AWS Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB to ensure efficient scaling and cost optimization, with careful query design to operate within free-tier limitations.
